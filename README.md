Flight Analysis Project (2019-2023)
Project Overview
This PowerBI project provides a comprehensive analysis of airline performance, punctuality, and flight logistics over a five-year period (2019–2023). The dashboard is designed to help travelers, industry analysts, and aviation experts understand global flight trends, identify the most reliable carriers, and diagnose the primary causes of flight delays.

The project visualizes complex datasets including arrival/departure delays, flight distances, geographical reach, and specific delay factors (weather, security, carrier issues, etc.).

Dashboard Structure
1. Performance & Global Reach (Page 1)
This page focuses on the high-level relationship between airlines and their operational efficiency.

Airline w.r.t Arrival and Departure Delay: A dual-line chart comparing average arrival vs. departure delays. It identifies which airlines struggle with punctuality and where operational gaps exist.

Top 10 Flights with Longest Flight Distance: An animated scatter plot (with a play axis) showing how flight distances have evolved. High-distance leaders like Southwest (WN) and Delta (DL) are clearly highlighted.

Airline and Its Origin: A global map visualization indicating the home countries/regions of major airlines, showing a high concentration in North America.

2. Efficiency & Punctuality Rankings (Page 2)
This page highlights "best-in-class" performers and high-level KPIs.

Key Metrics (KPI Cards):

Most Visited City: Chicago, IL.

Most Used Airline: ExpressJet.

Total Airlines Analyzed: 18.

Airlines Not Affected by Specific Delays: Pie charts showing the percentage of flights handled by specific airlines that managed to avoid weather delays, carrier delays, and late departures.

Least Delayed Airlines (Tree Map): A visual breakdown of airlines with the lowest average arrival delays. Smaller blocks represent higher punctuality (e.g., Alaska Airlines at 0.98 mins).

3. Deep Dive: Delay Diagnostics (Page 3)
A granular look at why delays happen and where these airlines fly.

Detailed Delay Matrix: A comprehensive table with integrated data bars that breaks down delays into specific categories:

Carrier Delay: Issues within the airline's control.

Late Aircraft Delay: Rotational delays from previous flights.

Weather/Security/NAS Delay: External factors.

Destination Map: A geographical visualization showing the global network coverage and destination hubs for the included airlines.

Key Insights & Objectives
Identifying Leaders: By comparing "Arrival Delay" metrics, the project identifies Alaska Airlines and Endeavor Air as top performers in punctuality.

Root Cause Analysis: The dashboard allows users to see that for many airlines (like SkyWest), "Delay due to Carrier" is a significantly larger contributor to total delay than "Weather" or "Security."

Distance Trends: Using the animated scatter plot, the project tracks how the "Longest Flight Distance" has fluctuated or grown between 2019 and 2023.

Operational Footprint: By comparing the Origin vs. Destination maps, users can analyze the market dominance of North American carriers on the global stage.

Technical Features
Interactive Play Axis: Used in the scatter plot to visualize temporal trends (2019–2023).

Data Bar Integration: Used within tables to provide an immediate visual sense of scale for numerical delay data.

Geospatial Mapping: Utilizes Microsoft Bing maps to plot airline origins and destinations.

Advanced Filtering: Includes a "Flight Date" slicer to allow users to drill down into specific years or timeframes.

Conclusion
This project transforms raw flight data into an actionable storytelling tool. It serves as a diagnostic instrument for understanding the complexities of the aviation industry, moving from high-level global trends down to specific minutes of delay per airline.
